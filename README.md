## Project Overview

[Demo](https://catstronaut-blog.up.railway.app/)

CatsTronauts is a full-stack application that demonstrates the use of GraphQL with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. This project serves as a learning resource for building and integrating GraphQL APIs with modern web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` folder: `cd server`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the GraphQL API server: `npm start`

### Client Setup

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `client` folder: `cd client`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the React application: `npm start`

The React application should automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

- `server`: Contains the code for the GraphQL server.
- `client`: Contains the code for the React application.
