 * single element in the DOM.
 *
 * If there is no SpaceKitProvider, print a warning and passthrough the
 * `children`
 *
 * This will assume that you don't actually care where the element is rendered
 * in the DOM.
 *
 * All changes to `children` will be ignored. A warning will be logged if
 * `children` changes. You should memoize `children` to avoid this warning.
